# test-project
Demo


Clone the project and open in android studio it will take some time for sync after that you can easily run the project

Code Approach:

MVVM Architecture
Coroutines
Recycler View
Retrofit
Fragments
Data Binding
Jitpack Libraries

Note: For fragments transaction i manually adds the fragment in the backstack but I have complete grip on nav graph if you wants
to perfrom some action using nav graph then definately i will do that.

Thanks
